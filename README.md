# Simulation-Modeling
We are all aware to some extent of the importance of simulation models in our world. Thousands of business, government, and service organizations develop simulation models to assist in making decisions concerning inventory control, maintenance scheduling, plant layout, investments, and sales forecasting. As a matter of fact, simulation is one of the most widely used quantitative analysis tools. To simulate is to try to duplicate the features, appearance, and characteristics of a real system. The idea behind simulation is to imitate a real-world situation mathematically, then to study its properties and operating characteristics, and, finally, to draw conclusions and make action decisions based on the results of the simulation. In this way, the real-life system is not touched until the advantages and disadvantages of what may be a major policy decision are first measured on the systemâ€™s model. This repository will show simple examples of how to do basic simulations using multiple general-purpose languages such as java, c#, and visual basic. Each folder will contain a single situation (question) and its solution in different languages.
